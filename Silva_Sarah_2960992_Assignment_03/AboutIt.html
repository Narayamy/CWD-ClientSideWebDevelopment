			<p>They are reptiles and their classification is as follows:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Class: Reptilia (Reptiles)</li>
				<li>Order: Squamata</li>
				<li>Family: Viperidae</li>
				<li>Genera: Crotalus and Sistrurus</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are many different species of rattlesnakes, depending on where they live.
			</p>
			<p>Rattlesnakes are known because of their heavy bodies and diamond-shaped heads. Most of people when hear about them are
				dominated by fear and anxiety and the only reason is because people are not used to deal with these animals.
			</p>
			<p>They are one of the most efficient and specialized predators on Earth. Their Rattle can be either a rattle or a partial
				rattle which is made of interlocking rings or segments of keratin (the same material of human fingernails are made of).
				Every time a rattlesnake sheds its skin it adds another segment to the rattle. This rattle is used to warn off potential
				predators and it is considered an extremely effective and high evolved predator-avoidance system. They also have a “pit”
				on each side of the head which is an organ that locates prey by heat-sensing.

			<p>Rattlesnakes can reach up to eight feet, depending on the specie. Most species have a pattern with dark diamonds, rhombuses
				or hexagons on a light background. Other characteristic of rattlesnakes is that they give birth to living little snakes;
				they do not lay eggs like other species of snakes. They also have vertical pupils, like cat’s eyes which also mean they
				have very good skills at night, especially in hot summer.
