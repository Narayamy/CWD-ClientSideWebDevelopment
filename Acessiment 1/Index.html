<h2>About me</h2>
<p>My name is Sarah Narayamy Tavares Silva, I have only one big brother, who lives in Sweden. I graduated in Biology in Brazil in 2010. I am from the southeast area of Brazil, in a state called Minas Gerais, which is known by its Cheese bread creation and its lots of gastronomic diversity.
There are many reasons I have decided come to Ireland. Firstly I wanted to leave Brazil due to the economic situation of the country; secondly, I wanted to experience a new culture, live abroad and improve my English. Thirdly I wanted to improve myself as a person and professionally, which brings me to the reasons I have decided to do Computing Science.
There are also a lot of reasons that made me decide to do Computing, one of them is that is an always improving, adapting, and changing area, in which there are several opportunities for jobs in different areas. I could point the Visa issue, but that is irrelevant considering I am talking about my future.
I have been living in Ireland for over 2 years now and havenâ€™t gone to Brazil to visit my parents yet, due to flight prices and it is quite hard to get work holidays when you work part-time, which makes me want to save money more than expend money going to Brazil.
